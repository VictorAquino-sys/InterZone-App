Provide categories:
    Implement the dropdown for category selection in the PostScreen.tsx This allows you to structure the data with categories from the outset, which is easier than retrofitting data categorization later.

    Enhance the HomeScreen to display categories for exisiting posts, which can be a quick upgrade to the user interface and immediately improve the user experience.
[Medium]
Develop Business Profiles:
    Once categories are in place and working smoothly, start designing and implementing the business profile feature. This includes setting up the different registration process, profile management capabilities, and the prioritization in feeds.

    Use the insights gained from the initial category implementation to tailor the business profile features, such as which categories are most popular and what specific needs businesses might have.

[Low]
Iterative Development and Feedback:
    Use feedback from users on the category implementation to refine and adjust the feature.
    Similarly, lauch a minimum viable product (MVP) for business profiles to select businesses and gather feedback to make iterative improvements before a full rollout.
