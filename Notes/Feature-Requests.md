Next Steps:
User Feedback: Start gathering feedback on the current features and what users might want next.

Market Research: Look into what similar apps are doing, and see if there are industry-specific features that are expected but missing in your app.

Prototype and Test: For each new feature idea, prototype it, and conduct user testing sessions to gather early feedback.

Each of these features can help enhance the functionality, user engagement, and overall value of your app, turning it into a more comprehensive platform.

Provide categories:
    Implement the dropdown for category selection in the PostScreen.tsx. 
    This allows you to structure the data with categories from the outset, which is easier than retrofitting data categorization later. (DONE)

    Enhance the HomeScreen to display categories for exisiting posts, which can be a quick upgrade to the user interface and immediately improve the user experience. (Done)

Develop Business Profiles:
    Once categories are in place and working smoothly, start designing and implementing the business profile feature. This includes setting up the different registration process, profile management capabilities, and the prioritization in feeds.

    Use the insights gained from the initial category implementation to tailor the business profile features, such as which categories are most popular and what specific needs businesses might have.

Iterative Development and Feedback:
    Use feedback from users on the category implementation to refine and adjust the feature.
    Similarly, lauch a minimum viable product (MVP) for business profiles to select businesses and gather feedback to make iterative improvements before a full rollout.
